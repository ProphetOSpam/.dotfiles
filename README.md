# My Dotfiles
These are my dotfile configuration files for different software in Bash.
## .nanorc
This is my custom .nanorc configuration for Nano.
## .bashrc
This is my custom .bashrc configuration for Bash.

These are not my actual dotfiles, this is for a CSCE240 assignment.
My actual dotfiles are managed with NixOS, [here](https://gitlab.com/ProphetOSpam/nixos-config/)
